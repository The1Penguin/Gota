* Göta

Göta will, hopefully, become a layout generator for [[https://codeberg.org/river/river][River]].
I wanted this to be written in Haskell, since I love the language.
However, the interacing with wayland or wlroots made it difficult.
I decided to switch to Rust, due to being more functional than the alternatives I found.
It will mainly be based on how [[https://git.sr.ht/~novakane/rivercarro][rivercarro]] and [[https://gitlab.com/akumar-xyz/riveroverflow][riveroverflow]], in that I want it to be like rivercarro, since I have used that for multiple years, but want an overflow system as well that mimics how [[github.com/YaLTeR/niri][niri]] does scrolling.

From [[https://github.com/pkulak/filtile][filtile]], I found [[https://github.com/MaxVerevkin/river-layout-toolkit][river-layout-toolkit]], which hopefully will allow this to be more easily implemented
