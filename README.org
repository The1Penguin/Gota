* Göta

Göta will, hopefully, become a layout generator for [[https://codeberg.org/river/river][River]].
Since I am a nerd, it will obviously be written in Haskell, and have a flake ;P.
It will mainly be based on how [[https://git.sr.ht/~novakane/rivercarro][rivercarro]] and [[https://gitlab.com/akumar-xyz/riveroverflow][riveroverflow]], in that I want it to be like rivercarro, since I have used that for multiple years, but want an overflow system as well that mimics how [[github.com/YaLTeR/niri][niri]] does scrolling.

This will however entail fixing a lot of bindings, and probably using template Haskell, which I am not used to other than messing around with lenses.

** Challenges
- Wayland-scanner / protocol stuffs
- C bindings
